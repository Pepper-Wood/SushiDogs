        <h1>Hey guys, it's Pepper</h1>
        <p>Been giving a lot of thought to this and realize that I've been wanting to say something and didn't feel comfortable saying it. I was honestly really hurt the other day. Mew put up a message in the discord asking for people interested in helping out with the ARPG while the ownership was changing over. Of course, I immediately messaged Mew about volunteering for help.</p>
        <p>A few days later, I got a message from Nomen along the lines of, "hey, would you be up for trying to program a few of our ideas?". All of Thursday and Friday of last week, Nomen and I were bouncing ideas back and forth at each other. It was the most fun I'd had with developing the ARPG in a long time.</p>
        <p>And in the end, I thought we made something super cool: <a href="https://adoptapedia.com/SushiDogs/">https://adoptapedia.com/SushiDogs/</a>. A website with a backend that would allow the user to log into the website and store their soosh information. I started working on an easier trading post using a database that only admins would be able to modify. Dailies was done with just clicking a single button. I also realized that under the current dailies system, it would take a person <b>14 years</b> to level up <i>just Gathering</i> to Hero status; trust me on the math for that number. That was really funny in retrospect.</p>
        <p>Nomen invited Chital to our server, which we were using to keep track of all our ideas in an easier way than having to search through one single chat log. We had ideas! We had a working prototype!</p>
        <p>Chi assumed we were working behind the other mods' backs, left two messages, and immediately left.</p>
        <p>All I wanted to do was make the ARPG fun again. I've made countless websites for Sushi Dogs just cause it was fun and I wanted to make cool stuff for people. Instead, I don't feel like I'm even the time of day.</p>
        <p>I'll set up the roller again in exchange for a recurring service fee, if you want it back. But regardless, I insist that the Dailies system be readjusted; it's not fair to people who do dailies every day to believe that eventually they'll be able to get to Hero.</p>
        <p>For Chital - idk if you're still interested in the trait visualizer system, but I'll have to go back and request it paid USD instead of the mythical.</p>
        <p>Pleasure doing business with you. - Pepper</p>
